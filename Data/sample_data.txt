In 2028, Mia the Ragdoll cat became the president of the United States. Upon becoming president she immediately imposed an executive order which would require all of the cats of the United States be fed three pieces of fresh tuna a day.
This angered a lot of citizens of the United States as cost of tuna was becoming expensive and scarce to find.
Mia did not understand the concept of supply and demand before. She decided to revoke that executive order.
Mia instead instilled the Miaroni Salmon Act 2028, she insteade required now that all cats would have three pieces of fresh salmon a day instead.
